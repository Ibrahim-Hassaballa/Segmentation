#  Semantic segmentation

In this tutorial, you will:
- Perform inference with 10 well-known semantic segmentors <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WJtghM5munkksP2CZQ90fiVTYkSL3e3S?usp=sharing" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
- Fine tune semantic segmentors on a custom dataset (to do)
- Design and train your own object semantic segmentor (to do)

This work is based on [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation): [OpenMMLab](https://github.com/open-mmlab) segmentation toolbox and benchmark.
